> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Isn't she lovely
Isn't she wonderfull
Isn't she precious
Less than one minute old
I never thought
through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely
made from love
Isn't she pretty
Truly the angel's best
Boy I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe
what God has done
through us he's given
life to one
But isn't she lovely
made from love

Isn't she lovely
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not
been done
Without you who
conceived the one
That's so very lovely
made from love
